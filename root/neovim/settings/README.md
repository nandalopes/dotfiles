# Settings

Files follow a name convention:

  - Settings for Vim built-ins at `builtin-{name}.vim`
  - Settings for specific languages at `lang-{name}.vim`
  - Settings of specific plugins or bundles at `plugin-{name}.vim`

Use `before` folder to overwrite things like leader or configure things before
plugins load.

Use `after` folder to do things after plugins and all the stuff loads.
